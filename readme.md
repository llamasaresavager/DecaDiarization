    ```

2. Activate the newly created Conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate myenv
    ```

3. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/llamasaresavager/DecaDiarization.git
    ```

4. Navigate to the cloned project directory:

    ```bash
    cd DecaDiarization
    ```

5. Rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and update it with your configuration:

    ```bash
    mv .env.sample .env
    ```

6. Register for a Hugging Face API key by visiting [https://huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join). After obtaining your API key, add it to the `.env` file as follows:

    ```
    HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY
    ```

7. Before using the pyannote/speaker-diarization model from Hugging Face, you need to agree to the terms and conditions specified by the model. The model requires you to share your contact information to access it. This repository is publicly accessible, but you have to accept the conditions to access its files and content.

    The collected information will help acquire a better knowledge of pyannote.audio userbase and help its maintainers apply for grants to improve it further. If you are an academic researcher, please cite the relevant papers in your own publications using the model. If you work for a company, please consider contributing back to pyannote.audio development (e.g. through unrestricted gifts). We also provide scientific consulting services around speaker diarization and machine listening.

    For more information and to accept the terms, please visit the pyannote/speaker-diarization model page on Hugging Face: [https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization).

8. Install all the necessary Python packages from the `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Start the FastAPI server and the Streamlit UI by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This command will initiate the FastAPI server and launch the Streamlit UI. Now, you can use the UI to upload a WAV file, select a task (either diarization or transcription), and choose a destination for the output file. The chosen task will process the uploaded file, and the results will be displayed in the Streamlit application and also saved to the specified destination.

Please ensure to have a valid WAV file for diarization and make adjustments to the request accordingly.

## Example Result

To provide an example of the output generated by the application, we have included a result image below:

This image showcases the diarization and transcription results for a sample audio file.
